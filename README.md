# Notes-Taking-App

* A Simple Note-Taking App using Python & Tkinter

# Tkinter - 
Tkinter is a standard Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a set of tools and widgets that allow you to build windows, buttons, menus, text entry fields, and other visual components for your Python applications.

## ttk:
The ttk module stands for "Themed Tkinter" and provides a set of improved and themed widgets. These widgets have a more modern and consistent look across different operating systems compared to the default Tkinter widgets. The ttk module includes widgets like buttons, labels, entry fields, comboboxes, progress bars, and more.
By importing ttk, you gain access to these themed widgets and can use them in your GUI application. You can create instances of these widgets and add them to your windows or frames, just like the standard Tkinter widgets. The benefit of using ttk widgets is that they have a more polished appearance and often provide additional features or customization options.

## messagebox: 
The messagebox module is a part of Tkinter that provides functions for displaying standard dialog boxes or message boxes to the user. These message boxes can be used to show information, ask for confirmation, or prompt for user input. The module includes functions such as showinfo, showwarning, showerror, askquestion, askyesno, askokcancel, and more.
